## toast.conf
 - TOML file with sections per Slice
 - Each section:
   - A (GitHub) repository identifier (`<org>/<name>`) to:
     - Match against `push` payload
     - Poll for changes
   - A path to the cloned repository root
     - Trailing slash removed by `os.normpath`
   - Name of the deployed branch
   - (optional) a GitHub Secret
   - (optional) GitHub Deploy key for private repository polling
   - Deployment options:
     - `vars` section to be interpreted by playbooks
 - Toast section:
   - Port number
 - Ansible globals (`toast.vars`)
   - Passed to each invocation

## CLI
Commands: 
 - `status`:
   - is toastd running
   - For each slice:
     - Does it exist on disk?
     - Is is up-to-date with the local remote?
     - (?) how long since the last `fetch`?ยน
     - Did the last ansible run without error?ยน
     - ยน This would be best kept in some kind of log...
 - `fetch`:
   - Force-fetch on slice(s)
 - `run`:
   - Force-run slice

IPC endpoint drops anything not from 127.0.0.1
